## RECI-BEE | FOOD APP

Reci-bee website was created to be a recipe management and meal planner app, with daily nutritional analysis and recommendations.

We divided the work equally, so we both could have the chance to work on all aspects of it: backend development with Ruby on Rails and front-end with JavaScript, React, Postgres. We set up the project as two servers communicating through API queries utilizing Webpack. In the front-end, we choose to work with flex-box and styled it ourselves with CSS.

## Getting Started

1. Install Frontend dependencies using the `npm install` command.
2. Install Backend dependencies using the `bundle install` command.
3. Start both servers using the `rake start` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:3000/> and the client at <http://localhost:3001/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.
