Balsamic & Basil Bruschetta
Yield: 8-10 servings 
Total Time: 10 min (+ 2 hrs optional ‘melding’ time)
7 medium tomatoes, diced
1/4 medium red onion, finely chopped*
1/3 cup (20-25 leaves) fresh basil, thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
1 Tbsp (15 mL) balsamic vinegar
1 tsp (5 mL) olive oil
1/2 tsp (2.5g) garlic powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1. Add all ingredients to a medium bowl and gently toss until combined. When adding the tomatoes, allow any juice that seeped out when cutting to remain on the cutting board; do not add this to the bowl.
2. Although you can enjoy immediately, it’s best to cover and let sit in the fridge for at least 2 hours to allow the flavours to meld.
3. Serve fresh on toasted bread, or even toast together in the oven for a warm bruschetta. Personally, I enjoyed it best when spreading some hummus on the toasted bread before adding the mixture on top. Garnish with fresh basil if desired. Enjoy!

1/2 medium pomegranate, seeded 1 banana, sliced
